# Pixel Art Maker

In this exercise, you'll create your own pixel art maker which will allow a user to choose colors from a palette and then "paint" pixel art. The interface is completely up to you, but it could look something like this.

![Example of Pixel Art Maker](pixel-art-maker-alt.png)

More specifically, your pixel art maker should allow a user to do the following.

1. Start with a blank canvas of "pixels".
1. Select a color from a palette.
1. Paint the pixels on the canvas using the selected color.

Here's a development workflow that we recommend you use.

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Create a small, 2x2 grid canvas made up of white, square `div` tags with a border.
1. Add an event listener to each `div` so when clicked the background turns red.
1. Create a small palette of two colors (e.g. red and blue) below the canvas using more `div` tags.
1. Add an event listener to these `div` tags so when clicked the current "brush" color is remembered.
1. Expand the dimensions of the pixel canvas.
1. Expand the palette with the rest of the standard colors as well as an eraser. (i.e. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, gray, black, white, etc.)
1. Expand the palette with a current color indicator so the user knows which color was last selected.
1. Improve the look and feel of the canvas and color palette. Be careful not to break your program's behavior!

### Bonus 1

Add a color picker which allows the user to select any color using the [`<input type="color">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color) and the [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change).

### Bonus 2

Add tools that augment the type of user interaction

- Pencil tool: Click and drag across the canvas to paint pixels.
- Selection tool: Click and drag across the canvas to paint all pixels that fall inside a rectangular selection.

### Deployment

Review the following articles on the Surge platform and then deploy your website to production.

- [Getting started with Surge](http://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge)
- [Remembering a domain](http://surge.sh/help/remembering-a-domain)

A good domain name for this project is `USERNAME-pixel-art-maker.surge.sh` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username in all **lowercase** letters. Once deployed and everything works as you expect, copy the URL to your site and paste it below.
